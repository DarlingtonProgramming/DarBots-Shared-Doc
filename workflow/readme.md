# Workflow

As our robotics team continues growing and absorbing the experience from previous competitions, we understand that it is critical for us to regulate our design process.

## Before we build

There are several steps that needs to be taken before we actually build our robot. During our iteration process, we need to gather up ideas. Thus before the actual building decision is made, our team should be split into several small groups discussing possible solutions to the game challenge. In order for the team to decide what ideas to take and come up with a comprehensive solution, teams should be prepared to present their ideas.

### 1. Design first.

A CAD design or a sketch design must took place before our builders start working on our robots. Because small groups are supposed to evaluate the pros and cons of their ideas, they must make a CAD file to ensure that there are enough space for the rev expansion hub, battery pack, phone case and cables. For details of wiring guidelines and building guidelines, groups should visit [FTC wiring guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-wiring-guide.pdf) and [FTC building resources](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/robot-building-resources).   
During the brainstorming period, groups have `2 weeks` to prepare for all the materials they need and pitches they might think of.

### 2. Presentation

After teams are ready for their presentations, they will present to the team on the last meeting of the second week. During the weekend, team members (especially team leaders) will gather up and discuss about their concerns for the pitches and possibilities of those pitches. 

### 3. Post-Decision

After the team decides their final decision on what mechanisms to use, they will demo their ideas during the weekend and the third week. At the same time, it is important for the CAD people to make CAD files on the final product of group thinking to ensure sizing limitations.

### 4. During the two-week period

A group of talented builders will be assigned to build possible chassis demos during the two week period. Another group of people will be selected to be lessoned on programming. At the same time, they also need to prepare for the presentations. Those people are likely to be the leaders in the building period.

## Building Period

Building period lasts for `2 weeks`, during the period the team is splited into different small groups and each group is assigned with a specific part of the robot. The part of the robot is called a `module`.   
At the same time, programmers should quickly look at the ability of the FTC SDK kit to put up standards across all programs so that there should not be two people writing different codes but work the same.   
`modules` are supposed to be finished at least two days before the building period ends so that those things can be put together and wired.   

## Programming Period

Programming period lasts for `1-2 weeks`, depend on the time left for the matches to start. Programmers need to use `github` to collaborate online to speed up the autonomous and teleop writing and leave more time for the testing period.

### Testing Period

Testing period, consisting of `>= 60%` of the programming period's time length, is a period inside the programming period that allows programmers to test their autonomous program and adjust robot params.

## Driver-train Period

Driver-training period, lasting for `0-2 weeks`, is a period for team's drivers to get used to robot controls and it is also a time for team to do massive testing to see if there is any potential problem with the robot.
